Tensix is a multitasking operating system for computers with 16-bit address
space. It provides memory- and process management, as well as a virtual
filesystem. tensix can be run as an application on other systems in order
to utilize up-to-date development tools. (This is still the only way to
run it.) tensix is very modular and can be gradually shrunk down to provide
only memory management.
