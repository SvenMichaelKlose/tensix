The nix terminal
================

The terminal understands the ASCII control codes BS, CR, DEL, EOT, FF, LF and
VT, as described in ISO 646. All other control codes are ignored. The form feed
character (FF) clears the screen and moves the cursor to the leftmost column of
the first line. If an EOT is read, the current buffer is sent to the process,
not including the EOT character.

The console is accesible as file 'con' in the root directory.

By default, the console is line-buffered and echoed.
Input is sent to the process if a line feed character (LF) was read (the enter
key was pressed).

Alternative modes can be used by opening a subdirectory file of the console
device. It's name is composed of the character 'b' for no buffering and/or the
character 'e' for no echo. 

Some examples:

	/con	Line-buffering and echo.
	/con/b  Unbuffered, with echo.
	/con/be Unbuffered, without echo.
