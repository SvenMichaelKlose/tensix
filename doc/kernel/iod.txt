I/O daemon

1. Features

The I/O daemon (or 'iod' for short) is a kernel process which copies data
between files. Drivers run in the context of the iod.

2. Controlling the I/O daemon

Commands must be written to file '/iod'. Writes must be immediate (see
bsend()) to read return values.

Here's an example how to print the local file README to the console.

    open (&iod, "/iod");
    open (&source, "/local/README");
    open (&destination, "/con");

    bref (&buffer, iod, 0, IO_CREATE | IO_NOWAIT);
    IOD_INIT_CMD_CREATE(buffer, source, destination,
			IODCHN_IMMEDIATE | IODCHN_AUTOCLOSE);
    err = bsend (buffer);

    close (destination);
    close (source);
    close (iod);

3. Commands

There two commands the iod understands:

    IODCMD_CREATE
    IODCMD_DESTROY

4. IODCMD_CREATE

This command requires flags that determine how the created channel should
work:

    IODCHN_AUTOCLOSE
    IODCHN_POLL
    IODCHN_INTR
    IODCHN_IMMEDIATE

4.1. IODCHN_AUTOCLOSE

The channel is removed automatically if no source buffer could be read.
Doesn't work with streams.

4.2. IODCHN_POLL

The source file cannot signal incoming data and must be test-read regularly
by the daemon.

4.3. IODCHN_IMMEDIATE

Block process until the channel was autoclosed. Implies IODCHN_AUTOCLOSE.
