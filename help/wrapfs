!!! WRAPFS IS A DIRTY HACK! USE AT YOUR OWN RISK! BACKUP YOUR DATA! !!!

wrapfs - Filesystem driver

In case the kernel is run on a UN*X, this driver mounts its filesystem into
nix' filesystem. Using 'dup' one can create a new instance of the driver:

    dup /wrapfs / local

mounts the local UN*X filestem into the root directory.
The directory may be removed with 'rm'.
