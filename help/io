io - I/O daemon file copy.

Syntax: io SOURCE_FILE DESTINATION_FILE

Commands the I/O daemon to copy SOURCE_FILE to DESTINATION_FILE. Both files
must exist already. If the destination file is not a stream file, its content
will be overwritten from the start.
The I/O channel is closed automatically by the daemon.

IMPORTANT:

The command might return before the file copy was started or finished.
Because the I/O daemon runs independently from the shell process, there'll
be no error messages.
