The kernel built-in shell
=========================

This shell is compiled into the kernel to allow execution of simple functions
to navigate through the virtual filesystem and to run other processes. The
shell is started as soon as the kernel is loaded and all components are
initialised.

When started, the shell shows as prompt '#' to signal that the user should
type in a command. A command consists of a name, followed by arguments,
all separated by one or more whitespaces:

    COMMAND_NAME [ARGUMENT_1 [ARGUMENT_2]]

If the command is unknown, a question mark is answered:

    # fnord
    ?
    #

Some commands do not require arguments - like 'help' which prints the
names of all available commands. Here's what it looks like to use it:

    # help
    create mkdir exit mkfs help pwd mem ls io ps cd rm 
    #

If you need more specific help, use the command in question as the first
argument of 'help'.
